He\u2019s just gone through a painful break-up, thanks in part to his drinking, can\u2019t write his second novel, and carouses too much with his magazine editor. Rather than face reality, Jonathan turns instead to his fantasies \u2014 moonlighting as a private detective \u2014 because he wants to be a hero and a man of action."}
